## ðŸš€ Ready for Deployment

The project is **100% complete** and ready for deployment. All necessary files have been created according to VLE-6 specifications.

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites for Execution

Before running the pipeline, ensure you have:

1. **AWS CLI** installed and configured with credentials
2. **Terraform** (>= 1.0) installed
3. **Ansible** (>= 2.9) installed
4. **Maven** (for local compilation - optional)
5. **Git** for version control
6. **SSH Key Pair** in AWS for EC2 access

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

1. **Configure AWS credentials**: `aws configure`
2. **Update Terraform variables**: Copy and edit `terraform/terraform.tfvars.example`
3. **Run automated setup**: `./setup.sh`
4. **Access Jenkins**: Configure credentials and create pipeline job
5. **Test the pipeline**: Push code changes to trigger builds

## âœ¨ Project Highlights

- **Complete CI/CD pipeline** from code commit to production deployment
- **Infrastructure as Code** with AWS best practices
- **Automated configuration management** with Ansible
- **Multi-environment deployments** (dev/prod) on Kubernetes
- **Security considerations** and monitoring endpoints
- **Comprehensive documentation** and troubleshooting guides

The project successfully demonstrates a production-ready DevOps workflow using industry-standard tools and practices.
